## An Instagram Bot that checks your emails, summarises them using ChatGPT, and sends you the summaries in your Instagram inbox
- Uses the Gmail API, OpenAI API, and a library for accessing Instagram called Instagrapi
- Also uses pystray to run as a tray application

# Want to use it for yourself?

I would love to offer this service for free - I write code out of passion instead of monetary incentive...
### but
OpenAI API calls cost **REAL** money, and are charged on a per call basis. You can imagine that providing this as a free service would be incredibly expensive for me.

I've tried to make this as affordable as possible, so you can see below which plan works best for you:
