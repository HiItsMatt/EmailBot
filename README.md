## An Instagram Bot that checks your emails, summarises them using ChatGPT, and sends you the summaries in your Instagram inbox

- Uses the Gmail API, OpenAI API, and a library for accessing Instagram called Instagrapi
- Also uses pystray to run as a tray application

## Want to use it for yourself? You've got two options:

## Option 1: PAID || $2.50+/Month

- Contact me, I can add your gmail and username to the program running on my computer and you will start receiving email updates through instagram with no effort on your behalf.

- I charge $2.50/month for this service as a baseline but depending on the volume of emails I may charge more. this is because OpenAI API calls cost real money, so the price will scale depending on how many calls have to be made. consider unsubscribing from spam emails to reduce the overhead cost so I can give you a better price.

- I would love to offer this service for free - I write code out of passion instead of monetary incentive, but you can understand that the API calls would get very expensive on my end if it was free.

## Option 2: FREE

- Run this program locally on your own computer. This will take some effort as this github repository is missing some important files because they are secret information and it would be unsafe to put on the internet.
- You will need to provide these files yourself for the program to work locally.
- Ensure you only have one version of python installed. Otherwise the process gets more complicated and I wont be able to provide support.

## Install Instructions:
- I am working on an installer that makes this process easier, but currently you will need to do these steps manually.
### Step 1: Clone Project Directory:
```
go to the repository on github: https://github.com/HiItsMatt/InstaMail
Clone the Github repository onto your own computer
navigate to EmailBot/Program - this is where all of the files you need to generate will go.
```

### Step 2: Install Prerequisites
```
run the following command to install all the required prerequisites:
python -m pip install pystray pillow openai google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client instagrapi python-dotenv
```

### Step 3: Generate Required Files
```
all of these files need to be generated for the program to work.
3a. Program/OpenAI_API_Key.txt
   - The key to your OpenAI account. so OpenAI knows who to charge for the API calls.

3b. Program/credentials.json
   - The credentials for accessing your Gmail Account.
   - Generated by logging into Google Cloud Console and adding the Gmail Api to a new project.

3c. Program/token.json
   - Generated automatically once authorised with Gmail
   - Allows the program access to your emails and allows the program to generate a new token when the current one expires

3d. Program/.env
   - Contains the username and password for the account that you want to recieve messages from
   - Contents should look like this:
        INSTA_USERNAME=Your_Bot_Account_Username
        INSTA_PASSWORD=Your_Bot_Account_Password
```
### Step 3. copy the InstaMail.bat file into your Startup Folder
```
4a. Open An instance of File Explorer and Navigate to the Project Directory
4b. Press Windows + R to open Run
4c. In Run type "shell:startup"
4d. Copy InstaMail.bat from the Project Directory into your Startup Folder.

This will run a command on startup that starts the python script without opening a terminal window.
```

This will run a command on startup that starts the python script without opening a terminal window.
