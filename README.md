**An Instagram Bot that checks your emails, summarises them using ChatGPT, and sends you the summaries in your Instagram inbox**
```
Uses the Gmail API, OpenAI API, and a library for accessing Instagram called Instagrapi
Also uses pystray to run as a tray application

Has a batch file in the startup folder that runs it in the background so I dont have to open it
when I turn on my computer. checks the 10 most recent emails on startup, just in case it missed
some while it wasnt running.
```

**Want to use it for yourself? You've got two options:**

**Option 1: PAID || $2.50+/Month**

   Contact me, I can add your gmail and username to the program running on my computer and
   you will start receiving email updates through instagram with no effort on your
   behalf.

   I charge $2.50/month for this service as a baseline but depending on the volume
   of emails I may charge more - this is because OpenAI API calls cost real money,
   so the price will scale depending on how many calls have to be made.
   consider unsubscribing from spam emails to reduce the overhead cost so I can
   give you a better price.

   I would love to offer this service for free - I write code out of passion
   instead of monetary incentive, but you can understand that it would get very
   expensive on my end if I offered this for free.

**Option 2: FREE**
```
   Run this program locally on your own computer. This will take some effort as this
   github repository is missing some important files because they are secret
   information and it would be unsafe to put on the internet.
   
   You WILL need to provide these files yourself for the program to work locally:
```
Program/OpenAI_API_Key.txt
```
   The key to your OpenAI account. so OpenAI knows who to charge for the API
   calls.
```
Program/credentials.json
```
   The credentials for accessing your Gmail Account.
   Generated by logging into Google Cloud Console and adding the Gmail Api
   to a new project.
```
Program/token.json
```
   Generated automatically once authorised with Gmail
   Allows the program access to your emails and allows the program to generate
   a new token when the current one expires
```
Program/.env
```
   Contains the username and password for the account that you want to recieve messages from
   Contents should look like this:
      INSTA_USERNAME=Your_Bot_Account_Username
      INSTA_PASSWORD=Your_Bot_Account_Password
```
Feel free to contact me for support if you want help! I'm usually available on Instagram @_hi_its_matt
